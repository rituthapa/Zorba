hello to the universe

git sommand sets 
set 1
git init
git status
git add .
git diff - to show differences if there's anything different between working dir and staging
git commit -m"firstcommit"
create remote remo in web applicaiton
git branch -M name of branch
git remote add origin Url.git
git push -u origin branch name
git clone URL.git (to pull entire folder to local repo, copy in remote remo n paste url here)

set 2
git pull- to pull each command/ single code to local
git log - to see total number of commits and statuses
git show HEAD - to show details of last commit (latest command/code) only
this has 3 cases:

case 1:
when you want to undo changes from working directory to be same as your last commit in your local machine
git checkout HEAD filename

case 2:
when you write some code in working directory and added to staging, but now you want to undo from staging to be same as last commit; 
git reset HEAD filename

to see the difference now if staging is like last commit and woring directory is same as the new changes; 
git diff

case 3:
when you made new changes to working directory and added it to staging and commit it to local machine; but realized you dont want topush this new changess and want the previous commit as it is and want to undo new changes from commit ; you have to reset this last commit as your previous commit; you write git rest and the first 7 characters from the commit that was before your Head(last) commit
git reset 4fde34f

int a=10000;
